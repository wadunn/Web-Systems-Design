Android Mobile App Final Project

This video is a demonstration of the Android Application I created as a final project for this course.  The app utilizes a Yelp API to allow the user to search for business near their location or a location of their choosing among other things. 
I cannot make the code for this project public on Github by request of the Professor for this course but can send privately by request if deemed necessary.
